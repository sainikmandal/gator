# gator üêä
A CLI tool RSS feed aggregator in Go

## No one uses RSS bro, why even do this shit?
A great man once said, we do pointless things because they are hard and we can do it. Well that was not what he said, neither he was a great man.

## Prerequisites
Now lets pretend that someone is reading this and (pretend 10 times that they are thinking of installing this)
Make sure you have Go and Postgres installed!

---

## Installation
Run:
```bash
go install github.com/sainikmandal/gator@latest
```

Before running gator make a config file in your root dir. Run:
```bash
touch ~/gatorconfig.json
```

Please do not get creative with the config file name, not here.
gator expects a config file with format:
```json
{
  "db_url": "postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/gatordb?sslmode=disable",
  "current_user_name": "demo"
}
```

okay now sing a nice prayer and run:
```bash
gator register [time to be creative]
```
